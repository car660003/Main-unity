- Water
- More camera types (3rd person, etc.)
- Volumetric cinema style clouds
- Procedural build up of snow and rain

Change Log:

2.3.0	:	2017-06-01
		-	Fog now supports volumetric point & spot lights. Turn on EnableFogLights on the fog script to see this in action. Lights must be added to the light manager. See readme.txt for more info.
		-	Refactor fog - it looks a lot better and scatters directional lights more realistically. Fog has proper 3D noise.
		-	Storm cloud sharpness now uses the same value as other cloud types for performance.
		-	Removed fog noise texture parameter as all fog uses a 3D noise texture now.
		-	Removed fog noise height parameters as fog noise is now 3D.

2.2.2	:	2017-05-17
		-	Fix lens flare to hide when medium, heavy or storm clouds are showing
		-	Fix rain not showing in demo scene

2.2.1	:	2017-05-11
		-	Fixes for: sharp cloud edges, dithering, linear color space cloud shadows, and sun shader
		-	Added CloudLightAbsorption property to SkySphereScript. This produces grayer, better looking clouds.
		-	Fix fog box prefab and add fog sphere prefab.

2.2.0	:	2017-05-05
		-	Added infrastructure for multiple suns. Only one sun is still supported currently. See the Suns array on WeatherScript.
		-	Added support for multiple moons. See the Moons array on WeatherScript. Multiple moons are supported! Earth moon and mars are added by default. Mars is obviously bigger than it should be.
		-	Sun and moons get slightly bigger at the horizon.
		-	Multiple camera support. See DemoSceneMultipleCameras. Sky sphere, rain, etc. and full screen fog render against multiple cameras.
		-	Moved the sky sun to it's own mesh renderer. This was needed to support multiple moons and multiple moon eclipses.

2.1.0	:	2017-04-26
		-	Clouds now cast shadows. See clouds section of Readme.txt for details.
		-	Fix WebGL compile errors.

2.0.3	:	2017-04-20

1.5.2	:	2016-11-30
		-	Added dithering to particles to eliminate banding in low-light conditions.
		-	Added secondary particle system option. Right now only rain uses this for a torrential rain effect. Other precipitation will get secondary particle systems soon.

		-	Change how time of day works - it is now a property (seconds) on the day night cycle script. Sun rotation is based on time of day instead of time of day being based off sun rotation now.
		-	Added lat / lon, timezone and day/month/year properties to day night cycle for accurate sun positions and seasons. See "WeatherMakerDayNightCycleScript.cs" for more details.
		-	Small tweaks to make asset easier to jump right into.
